# Calculator using Javascript including CSS styling
 
Hi,

I have used:

*Added Javascript function to evaluate the arithmetic expression.
*A dropdown menu for selecting an operator for the calculator.
*Hover for effect on calculate button.
*The code `submitButton.addEventListener("click", () => { ... })` is adding an event listener.
